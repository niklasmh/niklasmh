## Welcome to my profile 🚀

I am an employee [**@bekk**](http://bekk.no) 👨🏻‍💻 and my current mission in life is to make programming\* accessible by everyone! 🙌🏻

_*Programming, like in sending instructions to something, then that something executes those instructions. Computers does not need to be involved, however, they are highly beneficial when it comes to doing these sort of things._

### My favorite quotes 🧾

> _You think you know when you can learn, are more sure when you can write, even more when you can teach, but certain when you can program._ — Alan Perlis

> _People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware._ — Alan Key

> _There's a tendency to make jazzy educational software that's very uniform and therefore just like school. I'd like to see a company develop software for rebellious kids who don't want to go to school._ — Seymour Papert
